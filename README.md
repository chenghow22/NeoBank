# NeoBank

Project Objective:

Empower NeoBank's customer support team to proficiently monitor customer churn rate and satisfaction levels through an intuitive dashboard. Various strategic metrics have been derived to facilitate comprehensive monitoring, encompassing monthly active user numbers, user geographic insights, age group distributions, transaction frequencies, average transaction amounts, notification engagement rates, and average churn rates per month. The engagement metric definitions and customer segment classifications are outlined below:

**Customer Segment Definitions:**

- **Active customer:** Difference between the last transaction and the last data date ≤ 30
- **Inactive customer:** 30 < Difference between the last transaction and the last data date ≤ 60
- **Churned customer:** Difference between the last transaction and the last data date > 60

**Churn Rate Definition:**

The percentage of users who remain active from one time period to the next, gauging user retention effectiveness over time.

**Customer Age Group Definitions:**

- GenZ: 18 to 25
- Millennials: 25 to 40
- GenX: 40 to 55
- Baby boomers: 55 and above

**Additional Metrics Definitions:**

- **Monthly Active User (MAU):** The count of unique users performing at least one transaction in a given month, providing an overview of user activity.
- **Transaction Frequency:** The average number of transactions per user within a specific time period, reflecting user platform engagement.
- **Average Transaction Amount:** The average amount of money transacted by users within a specific time period, offering insights into financial activity.
- **Notification Engagement Rate:** The percentage of users accepting marketing push notifications and marketing email notifications if notifications are integral to user engagement.

**Analysis & Conclusion:**

The data highlights that the majority of customers originate from the UK (35%), followed by Ireland (11%) and Poland (9%). Despite a growing customer base, the observed average monthly churn rate of approximately 6.72% aligns favorably with industry benchmarks, signifying a healthy retention rate. Notably, baby boomers exhibit the highest monthly churn rate at 10.6%, while millennials boast the lowest at 5.89%. Furthermore, a discernible inverse relationship between churn rates and notification success rates suggests a positive impact of notifications on user retention throughout the customer lifecycle. Both email and push notifications boast around an 80% success rate.
